# Genetic Breakout
Reinforcement Learning using a Genetic Algorithm to train a neural network to play a version of the classic game Breakout
<br>Game starts with 3 rows.
<br>Each time the screen is cleared an additional row is added.
<br>Game continues for 15 levels with a max score of 1800.


<br>The training example uses a 24 input nodes for the game state
<br>1 hidden layer with 16 nodes with ReLU activation functions
<br>and a 3 node output layer with softmax activation.
